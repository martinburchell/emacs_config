# emacs_config

This is my Emacs configuration.

I've borrowed quite a lot from Jessica Hamrick https://github.com/jhamrick/emacs - thanks Jessica!

## Prerequisites

* makeinfo (Fedora package texinfo)
* pyflakes
* pep8 (Fedora package python-pep8)

## Installation

* Create symbolic links to .emacs and .emacs.d from your home directory.
* Copy the pycheckers script to somewhere on your path and make it executable.
* Start Emacs
